# Adblock Plus bar

## Intro

Small script that displays a warning to users who _don't_ have an adblocking
tool installed. Made as an example for [Kyle](https://kyledrake.neocities.org/)
who had the idea.

## Usage

Just add this to your page:

     <script type="text/javascript" src="https://static.kzar.co.uk/adblockplus-bar/adblockplus-bar.js"></script>
